# SQL Assignment: Exploring the Movies Database

## Overview
This repository contains my work on an SQL assignment centered around a comprehensive movies database. The primary focus is on the `metadata` table, which is a rich source of information about various movies. The skills and techniques applied here are also relevant and applicable to other tables within this database.

## Objectives
- **Deep Dive into Metadata**: The `metadata` table will be our playground. We'll explore various aspects of movies, such as titles, directors, release years, and much more.
- **Data Cleaning and Validation**: Ensuring data integrity by cleaning and validating the data within the `metadata` table.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Utilizing complex SQL queries to extract, analyze, and interpret the data. This includes operations like joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations.
- **Cross-Table Analysis**: While the main focus is on `metadata`, we will occasionally join with other tables to provide a more rounded analysis and uncover deeper insights.
- **Data Visualization and Insights**: Transforming our SQL query results into meaningful insights, possibly using additional tools for visualization.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, I aim to have strengthened my skills in SQL, particularly in dealing with large, real-world databases. I expect to become more proficient in data cleaning, query optimization, and drawing actionable insights from raw data.
